My first HTML/CSS project: a restaurant website, complete with a menu page and a takeaway form!

Conditional formatting rules applied on the stylesheet, so that it looks good on both desktop and mobile.

Being a beginner project, the takeaway form still doesn't have a back-end to process its information. To be completed once the necessary back-end knowledge is attained.
